Hello.

I'm back andâ€¦ I decided to ditch Wordpress and start from scratch with
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is static website generator written in Go.

Also, because I'm not good at webdesign, I decided to find some theme online and I
choose [Blackburn](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn) created by
[Yoshiharu Yamashita](http://yoshiharuyamashita.com).
